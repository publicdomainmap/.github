# Welcome to Public Domain Map

Public Domain Map is a project of [OpenStreetMap US](https://www.openstreetmap.us/) that allows map contributors across the United States to edit, contribute to, and consume federal datasets via a collaborative user environment and modified versions of popular OpenStreetMap tools; simultaneously improving government datasets and OpenStreetMap.

US Government agencies are increasingly realizing the value of crowdsourcing open data. Through Public Domain Map, government agencies can access the power of the crowd to improve government datasets and contribute validated data to OpenStreetMap. The toolstack includes newly developed public domain versions of the [Tasking Manager](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tasking_Manager)  & the [iD Editor](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID#:~:text=iD%20is%20an%20OpenStreetMap%20editor,editor%20at%20openstreetmap.org%20homepage.). The OpenStreetMap database is then improved with this authoritative data via [MapRoulette](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapRoulette).

All contributions remain in the public domain, which allows the original government public domain datasets to accept edits from users and allows the edits to be applied to OpenStreetMap.

### Engagement

Targeted end users include the general public, government agencies, the private sector and the OpenStreetMap community, but because Public Domain Map is improving open data, everyone who relies on OpenStreetMap or federal datasets benefits from higher quality, more complete and up-to-date geospatial data. 

Public Domain Map is developed and maintained in collaboration with the US Department of Transportation, US Geological Survey, and other federal agencies. 

## Contribution

Contribution guidelines will be developed soon! If you would like to contribute to the project at this stage, please reach out to us directly at <admin@publicdomainmap.org>.
